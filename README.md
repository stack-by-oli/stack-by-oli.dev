## 🚧 Under Construction Guide v1.0

This repository contains the foundation of my personal developer portfolio:  
a creative, modern, and responsive **“Under Construction”** landing page —  
designed and built as part of my Full Stack Developer journey.

---

### 🧠 **About this Project**

This is the first version (**v1.0**) of my portfolio project.  
It focuses on learning the fundamentals of:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Git & GitHub version control
- Clean structure and documentation

Future versions will evolve toward a complete full-stack web application.
